                <li>Today we learn about events in Aura component. An Aura Event is used to link multiple aura components and pass values from one component to another</li>
		<li>Events can also be defined as parent to child communication.</li>
		<li>Type of event : Component event -> which component can intract with each other and tht too are nested .. , Application event -> the two components are independent to each other but are 			connected..</li>
		<li>Steps for event:Create an event ,Register an event ,Fire event ,Handle event.</li>
		<li>Aura event will be register in child component and also fired in child component.</li>
		<li>And in parent component we should explicitly define the child component and parent component can get the value which has been set in child component.</li>
		<li>We do example of component event in which we create the account record in child component and pass it's recordID using the event into the parent component and in parent component we 			display the details of the newly created account record.</li>
		<li>But in component event both parent and child component will be in a same container. We can't use parent component in some page and the child component in some another page.</li>
		<li>So we use the application component event in which parent and child are independent of each other but also sharing the values to each other.</li>
		<li>Then we learnt about Lightning Data service(LDS). LDS is used for having standard controller and standard functions.</li>
		<li>Types of LDS are : lightning:recordForm , lightning:recordViewForm(read only mode) , lightning:recordEditForm(edit mode) , force:recordData</li>
		<li>lightning:recordForm is used for Display, create, or edit records and we cant provide customisation here</li>
		<li>lightning:recordViewForm(read only mode) is used to Display records with lightning:outputField</li>
		<li>lightning:recordEditForm(edit mode) is used toCreate or edit records with lightning:inputField</li>
		<li>force:recordData is used to Create, edit, or delete record data using your own custom UI components</li>

		<li>We fetch account details from apex and use it in component file.</li>
		<li>Toast : are the message box or notification box that a developer can show according to the action of the user.</li>
		<li>In toast we have Type => Success,Error,Warning,info.</li>
		<li>In toast we have Mode => Sticky,Pester,Dismissible</li>
		<li>And we have Title, Message ,duration in toast </li>
		<li>And we do a example in which just typing the name of account it will show us all the possible account names.</li>
		<li>We create aura attribute of account type to fetch data of account from apex.</li>
		<li>We use e.force:navigateToComponent for navigating to an another component on a click of button.</li>
		<li>And we can also navigate to SObject detail page by using e.force:navigateToSObject.</li>
		<li>We create a contact using aura component and give the toast for successful insertion.</li>

                <li>Today we learnt about aura components in Apex.</li>
		<li>Aura component consist of a component file, controller file, helper file, CSS Styles, Design, Documentation, Renderer and SVG file.</li>
		<li>We can define aura attributes in our cmp file. Attributes are used to store data</li>
		<li>In aura attributes we can also define collections like list,Set and map.</li>
		<li>We can also use if else scenario in cmp file. We can do so by using aura:if isTrue="{!v.truth}" and aura:set attribute="else"</li>
		<li>Styling in aura : Inline styling ,Internal styling,External styling ,Lightning design system</li>
		<li>We can also use an external file in aura. We can do so by creating a static resource.</li>
		<li>There we can also go for looping in aura. We can do so by using aura:iteration.</li>
		<li>To call a controller function in aura component we use 'c.functionName'. And to call a attribute of a component then we use 'v.attributename'.</li>
		<li>In aura component we can use aura id for any on change event and we can get the value by using the aura id eg- component.find("auraid").get("v.value").</li>
		<li>In controller class we can also call the methods of apex controller and can use those values for setting aura attributes.</li>
		<li>The function defined in apex controller should be aura enabled.</li>

                <li>Today we learnt about how to post data from salesforce org to an external system using REST Api.</li>
		<li>Then we learnt about SOAP Api. In SOAP, we use the WSDL document. Here we use generate from WSDL to apex tool to convert the xml file.</li>
		<li>And we can also expose our apex class to external system by converting apex class into the WSDL file. To do so the apex class method should have webservice in declaration.</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about Asynchronous Apex.Asynchronous Apex means the job will run in background when system will get the resources.</li>
		<li>Types of Asynchronous Apex are : Batch Apex,Future method,Queueable apex,Schedulable apex. In Asynchronous Apex, we get double the governor limit as it runs in background.</li>
		<li>In batch Apex we've three methods i.e. start, execute and finish. Also we can schedule the batch apex according to our need.</li>
		<li>Batch Apex is scheduled in two ways i.e. Goto apex class -> schedule class , Or we can schedule through CRON expression.</li>
		<li>CRON expression consist of :Second -0-59,Minutes -0-59,Hours -0-23,Date 1-31,Month - 1-12,days -1-7 or sun -sat,Year -  0ptional</li>
		<li>Example of CRON expression string cronExp = '20 30 9 6 8 ? 2022'; // 9:30:20 on 6th of august, 2022</li>
		<li>Future method can be used when a class contains two method and in one method we are inserting account(non- setup object) and in another method we're inserting a user(setup object) but          			second method is called in first method. Then it will have a problem of mixed DML operations. So we can declare the second method as Future method, then it 						will not be a problem.Future is also used when we are doing a callout in one function and from another function we're doing DML operation and calling that callout function.</li>
		<li>Queueable apex is used to enqueueJobs -> job chaining concepts. We can chain multiple jobs in Queueable apex.</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about Try-Catch Block in Apex. Try-Catch is used to handle the exceptions.</li>
		<li>In try block we write the code where we think an exception can be raised, and if an exception is raised we will catch that exception in the catch block.</li>
		<li>If we have a try block then there should be a catch block or if catch block is not there then we should have a finally block.</li>

                <li>Today we learnt about Deployment from sandbox to production.</li>
		<li>Firstly we ensured that our Sandbox is connected to our Production. We do so by going to deployment settings in production and for sandbox we checked the allow inbound changes.</li>
		<li>Then our connection between the sandbox and production is created, so we create an outbound changeset in the sandbox.</li>
		<li>After creating the outbound changeset, we should add the items which we want to deploy to production. And then upload that changeset to production.</li>
		<li>When the upload gets completed , then we should go to Production org and in that go to inbound changeset and validate the changeset and deploy it.</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about Apex Integration. Integration means to connect our Salesforce org to an external system.</li>
		<li>In integration API(application programming interface),Web service. API can be Rest Api and SOAP Api.</li>
		<li>Rest Api : It uses rest resources  -> URI ,Http methods : httpget,httppost,httppatch,httpdelete,httpput(upsert) ,It supports xml,text, JSON</li>
		<li>SOAP Api : simple object access protocol , Format XML only , It uses WSDL document </li>
		<li>We have done some Example of Integration. Firstly we use all the HTTP methods i.e. @httpget,@httppost,@httppatch,@httpdelete to access our salesforce org data from an 						external system i.e. Workbench.</li>
		<li>And then we do a restCallout example. In which we firstly define the external endpoint in remote site settings.</li>
		<li>Then we write an apex class for fetching the data from that endpoint URL in our Salesforce Org.</li>

		<li>We learnt about controller extension in VF Page. Extension controller can only be custom controller.</li>
		<li>In constructor of extension class we'll pass the parameter of reference of controller class defined in VF page</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about Apex Testing. Apex Testing is done by creating an apex class with annotation @istest.</li>
		<li>In test class we use  system.assertEquals(actual, expected);. AssertEquals use to validate two values are equal.</li>
		<li>In test class we'll try to cover all the lines of our Apex class. And if we succeeded we'll get Code Coverage as 100%</li>
		<li>In test class we can create our sample date for testing or we can use testData factory class for creating multiple test data at once.</li>
		<li>In test class we use  test.startTest(); and  test.stopTest(); for having new governor limits.</li>
		<li>And if a class method is private then how that method is going to visible in testing class. We can do so by @testVisible with class method.</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about Deployment. To deploy the stuff created in sandbox to production :We will use change set</li>
		<li>When we deploy from sandbox to production then we'll create an outbound changeset in sandbox and upload it to production</li>
		<li>And in production we'll go to inbound changeset and Verify the changeset and deploy it.</li>

		<li>Today we learnt about DML operations in Apex. DML operation can be insert, update, delete, undelete and upsert.</li>
		<li>In Upsert, if record is having key(ID) then that record will update else it will be created. We can use the external id instead of Salesforce record id.</li>
		<li>We learnt about partial DML operations. We can perform partial DML operations by using database methods.</li>

                <li>Today we learnt about collections in Apex. Container is used to store multiple values</li>
		<li>Collections can be of three types i.e List, Set and Map</li>
		<li>List allows duplicates in it.List is an ordered collection ,we can access the elements of list using index number which starts from 0 and go till n-1 where n is length of list</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about for-each loop in Apex. Eg: for(string lname : listName){}</li>
		<li>If we refer a list like list<string> li = listName; and clear the li using li.clear(); , then the referd list will be cleared or empty.</li>
		<li>Set is also collection like a list but it will not contain any duplicate variable.</li>
		<li>Map is the collection of key-value pair. Where key should be unique and value can be duplicate also.</li>
		<li>In Map, key are equivalent to Set and value are equivalent to list</li>
		<li>To fetch keys from a map we use keySet() and to fetch all values from a map we use values().</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about sObject in Apex. sObject is the super class(parent class) of all the objects in Salesforce.</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about SOQL in Apex. SOQL stands for Salesforce object query language.</li>
		<li>The return type of a SOQL is list<Sobject>. In SOQL we cant use * </li>
		<li>In SOQL we learnt about the where clause, where clause is used to filter the data.</li>
		<li>In SOQL we learnt about like operator ,order by clause and limit clause. Like operator is used for giving some condition where data should start with this or end with this. 				Order by clause is used to order data in ascending or descending order. And limit clause is to limit our data retrieval.</li>
		<li>There is an offset clause in SOQL which is used to specify from which position you want your records to be returned.</li>
		<li>In SOQL we learnt about Aggregate function, which can be :avg(),sum(),min(),max(),count()</li>
		<li>In SOQL we learnt about group by clause. It is used to group a data by some specific field.</li>

		<li>Constructors are Are used to initialise the instance variables of the class,also we can do the work which has to be done at the time of object creation.</li>
		<li>Constructor is constructor is almost same as method but without return type not even void and also it has the same name as its class name always. </li>
		<li>Constructor can be of two types i.e. non parameterise constructor and parameterise constructors</li>
		<li>Today learnt about this keyword in Apex. this keyword is used for referencing the current object.</li>
		<li>When the instance variable and local variable is having same name then we need to apply this keyword with instance variable to make it different from local variable</li>
		<li>This keyword is also used for calling the current constructor of the class.</li>
		<li>Today learnt about inheritance in Apex. In inheritance, We use extends keyword and Parent class must be defined as virtual or abstract</li>
		<li>We learnt about super keyword in apex. super keyword is used to call parent class parameterise constructor</li>
		<li>Parent pp = new Child(34,'aa'); // example of upward casting and runtime polymorphism</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about Abstract Class in Apex. Abstract Classes are Partially implemented,Can have abstract and complete methods,If any method needs to declare as abstract then that 				method needs to declare as abstract using abstract keyword,They cant be instantiated ..</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about interfaces in Apex. Just like abstract class but they are fully abstract</li>
		<li>Interfaces methods are by-default public and abstract and Interfaces cant have variables ,cant have constructors ,can only have incomplete method</li>

		<li>In development module we use Apex language for development on Salesforce</li>
		<li>Apex is strongly typed, object oriented programming language. Strongly typed means we should always specify the data type while working with variables</li>
		<li>Today learnt about Access specifier in Apex. There are four types of Access specifier i.e. Global,Public,protected,Private </li>
		<li>Today learnt about Apex variables and their data types. Various data types are Integer,Long,Double,Decimal -> currency type value,Boolean -> true/false,								String -> ‘’,Date,dateTime,sObject.ID</li>
		<li>Today learnt about casting concept in Apex. Casting can be done in two ways i.e. Downward casting -> long to integer (has to done explicitly ) and 								Upward casting -> integer to long (done automatically)</li>
		<li>Today learnt about Object oriented programming. In OOP, we learn Abstraction,Encapsulation,Inheritance,Polymorphism.</li>
		<li>Abstraction -> concept of hiding the complexity and showing the essential data as per requirement </li>
		<li>Encapsulation -> is concept of wrapping the variable and methods into single unit to prevent it from unwanted users.</li>
		<li>Inheritance -> one class/child class/derived class/sub class gets all non-private  property of another class/parent class/base class/super class</li>
		<li>Polymorphism -> one name and many forms..Two types of polymorphism : Compile time polymorphism / early binding / static binding => ex : method overloading							Runtime polymorphism/dynamic binding / late binding => ex : method overriding </li>
		<li>Today we learnt about Different types of variables in Apex</li>
		<li>First one is Instance variable  : gets loaded when object is created of that class,Every object will be having separate copy of instance variable,								If we want to access them so we need to call them using object</li>
		<li>Second one is Static variable/members  : gets loaded when class gets loaded ,Every object will be having same copy of static variable
				If we want to access them so we need to call them using Class Name</li>
		<li>Third one is Local variable : They declared inside the method or any block,They can be access within the class in which we have declared them</li>

		<li>Today learnt about Data Management in Salesforce</li>
		<li>Data Management can be done in two ways, first one is Data Import Wizard and second one is Data Loader.</li>
		<li>Data Import Wizard is the internal tool of Salesforce. Used to import data for all custom objects but not all standard objects. standard objects which are supported -> 					account,contacts , lead ,solutions and campaign member</li>
		<li>In data import wizard we can import auto 50000 records and Mapping must be done evrytimes as its not saved for future..</li>
		<li>Data Loader is an external tool, and we can import data for all custom objects and standard objects. We can import/export upto 5 million records at a time</li>
		<li>In data loader import, export and deletion is possible. And Mapping can be saved for future</li>
		<li>Today learnt about External ID in Salesforce. It's a unique field for a object, which we can use for data management from any external system.</li>

		<li>In Object Level, Field Level there are mainly derived by Profile and Permission Sets </li>
		<li>In Permission Sets are used to give extra access for any requirement </li>
		<li>In Record Level there are OWD,Role hierarchy,Sharing Rules and Manual sharing</li>
		<li>OWD can give base level security for records. In role hierarchy, the user in upper hierarchy can see the records of users of the lower hierarchy </li>
