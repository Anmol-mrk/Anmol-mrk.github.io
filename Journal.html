                <li>Today we learnt about Visualforce Pages in Apex. we can use VF page :From a tab and we can Override the standard and custom buttons or links</li>
		<li>VF page consist of two things i.e. Visualforce mark up and Controller.</li>
		<li>Controllers can be : Standard controller,Standard list controller,Custom controller,Controller extension</li>
		<li>We learnt about getter and setter methods in VF controller</li>
		<li>We learnt how to display data from Salesforce Org in VF Page.</li>
		<li>In VF page for looping we use : apex:repeat value="{!acc}" var="a" or apex:pageBlockTable value="{!acc}" var="a" align="center"</li>
		<li>We learnt about Page Reference in apex. PageReference pr = new PageReference('/apex/SimpleInsert');// refer to another vf page..// here SimpleInsert is the Vf page</li>
		<li>We learnt how to insert records from a VF page to Salesforce Org.</li>
		<li>We learnt about wrapper class in Apex. In wrapper class we can have multiple data types variables.</li>
		<li>In Standard controllers, Only one record can be fetched but multiple related record can be fetched.</li>
		<li>And in Standard list controller : we can fetch multiple records.</li>
		<li>We learnt about Filtration and pagination in VF page.</li>

                <li>Today we learnt about Relationship queries in Apex. Relationship queries can be of two types i.e. Parent to child and child to parent</li>
		<li>Parent to child -> related child record eg.-select name,(select firstname,lastname from contacts) from account</li>
		<li>Child to parent e.g. - select firstname,lastname,account.industry from contact</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about SOSL in Apex. SOSL stands for Salesforce Object Search Language</li>
		<li>SOSL syntax - Find ‘search text’ [IN search group] [returning objects and fields] . In search group :All fields,Name fields,Email fields,Phone fields</li>
		<li>Sosl doesnt support picklist.String sd ='genepoint';List<List<Sobject>> sobjs = [find :sd in all fields returning account(name),contact(accountId,firstname,lastname)];</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about DML operations in Apex. DML operation can be insert, update, delete, undelete and upsert.</li>
		<li>In Upsert, if record is having key(ID) then that record will update else it will be created. We can use the external id instead of Salesforce record id.</li>
		<li>We learnt about partial DML operations. We can perform partial DML operations by using database methods.</li>
		<li>Database methods can be : Database.insert(List<Sobject>,false);Database.update(List<Sobject>,false);Database.delete(List<Sobject>,false);Database.upsert(List<Sobject>,false);</li>

                <li>Today we learnt about collections in Apex. Container is used to store multiple values</li>
		<li>Collections can be of three types i.e List, Set and Map</li>
		<li>List allows duplicates in it.List is an ordered collection ,we can access the elements of list using index number which starts from 0 and go till n-1 where n is length of list</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about for-each loop in Apex. Eg: for(string lname : listName){}</li>
		<li>If we refer a list like list<string> li = listName; and clear the li using li.clear(); , then the referd list will be cleared or empty.</li>
		<li>Set is also collection like a list but it will not contain any duplicate variable.</li>
		<li>Map is the collection of key-value pair. Where key should be unique and value can be duplicate also.</li>
		<li>In Map, key are equivalent to Set and value are equivalent to list</li>
		<li>To fetch keys from a map we use keySet() and to fetch all values from a map we use values().</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about sObject in Apex. sObject is the super class(parent class) of all the objects in Salesforce.</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about SOQL in Apex. SOQL stands for Salesforce object query language.</li>
		<li>The return type of a SOQL is list<Sobject>. In SOQL we cant use * </li>
		<li>In SOQL we learnt about the where clause, where clause is used to filter the data.</li>
		<li>In SOQL we learnt about like operator ,order by clause and limit clause. Like operator is used for giving some condition where data should start with this or end with this. 				Order by clause is used to order data in ascending or descending order. And limit clause is to limit our data retrieval.</li>
		<li>There is an offset clause in SOQL which is used to specify from which position you want your records to be returned.</li>
		<li>In SOQL we learnt about Aggregate function, which can be :avg(),sum(),min(),max(),count()</li>
		<li>In SOQL we learnt about group by clause. It is used to group a data by some specific field.</li>
		<li>In SOQL we learnt about HAVING CLAUSE, which is used when we need to apply condition on Aggregate function field ,which can be applied with where clause</li>

                <li>Today we learnt about constructor in Apex</li>
		<li>Constructors are Are used to initialise the instance variables of the class,also we can do the work which has to be done at the time of object creation.</li>
		<li>Constructor is constructor is almost same as method but without return type not even void and also it has the same name as its class name always. </li>
		<li>Constructor can be of two types i.e. non parameterise constructor and parameterise constructors</li>
		<li>Today learnt about this keyword in Apex. this keyword is used for referencing the current object.</li>
		<li>When the instance variable and local variable is having same name then we need to apply this keyword with instance variable to make it different from local variable</li>
		<li>This keyword is also used for calling the current constructor of the class.</li>
		<li>Today learnt about inheritance in Apex. In inheritance, We use extends keyword and Parent class must be defined as virtual or abstract</li>
		<li>We learnt about super keyword in apex. super keyword is used to call parent class parameterise constructor</li>
		<li>Parent pp = new Child(34,'aa'); // example of upward casting and runtime polymorphism</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about Abstract Class in Apex. Abstract Classes are Partially implemented,Can have abstract and complete methods,If any method needs to declare as abstract then that 				method needs to declare as abstract using abstract keyword,They cant be instantiated ..</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about interfaces in Apex. Just like abstract class but they are fully abstract</li>
		<li>Interfaces methods are by-default public and abstract and Interfaces cant have variables ,cant have constructors ,can only have incomplete method</li>

                <li>Today we started the development module in Salesforce</li>
		<li>In development module we use Apex language for development on Salesforce</li>
		<li>Apex is strongly typed, object oriented programming language. Strongly typed means we should always specify the data type while working with variables</li>
		<li>Today learnt about Access specifier in Apex. There are four types of Access specifier i.e. Global,Public,protected,Private </li>
		<li>Today learnt about Apex variables and their data types. Various data types are Integer,Long,Double,Decimal -> currency type value,Boolean -> true/false,								String -> ‘’,Date,dateTime,sObject.ID</li>
		<li>Today learnt about casting concept in Apex. Casting can be done in two ways i.e. Downward casting -> long to integer (has to done explicitly ) and 								Upward casting -> integer to long (done automatically)</li>
		<li>Today learnt about Object oriented programming. In OOP, we learn Abstraction,Encapsulation,Inheritance,Polymorphism.</li>
		<li>Abstraction -> concept of hiding the complexity and showing the essential data as per requirement </li>
		<li>Encapsulation -> is concept of wrapping the variable and methods into single unit to prevent it from unwanted users.</li>
		<li>Inheritance -> one class/child class/derived class/sub class gets all non-private  property of another class/parent class/base class/super class</li>
		<li>Polymorphism -> one name and many forms..Two types of polymorphism : Compile time polymorphism / early binding / static binding => ex : method overloading							Runtime polymorphism/dynamic binding / late binding => ex : method overriding </li>
		<li>Today we learnt about Different types of variables in Apex</li>
		<li>First one is Instance variable  : gets loaded when object is created of that class,Every object will be having separate copy of instance variable,								If we want to access them so we need to call them using object</li>
		<li>Second one is Static variable/members  : gets loaded when class gets loaded ,Every object will be having same copy of static variable
				If we want to access them so we need to call them using Class Name</li>
		<li>Third one is Local variable : They declared inside the method or any block,They can be access within the class in which we have declared them</li>

		<li>Today learnt about how to create groups in chatter in Salesforce. There are five types of groups i.e. Public Group, Private Group, Customer Group, Broadcast Group and Unlisted Group			</li>
		<li>Today learnt about Data Management in Salesforce</li>
		<li>Data Management can be done in two ways, first one is Data Import Wizard and second one is Data Loader.</li>
		<li>Data Import Wizard is the internal tool of Salesforce. Used to import data for all custom objects but not all standard objects. standard objects which are supported -> 					account,contacts , lead ,solutions and campaign member</li>
		<li>In data import wizard we can import auto 50000 records and Mapping must be done evrytimes as its not saved for future..</li>
		<li>Data Loader is an external tool, and we can import data for all custom objects and standard objects. We can import/export upto 5 million records at a time</li>
		<li>In data loader import, export and deletion is possible. And Mapping can be saved for future</li>

		<li>In Data Security there are four levels that are Organisation level, Object Level, Field Level and Record Level </li>
		<li>In Organisation level there are password policies, login hours, login IP ranges and manage users </li>
		<li>In Object Level, Field Level there are mainly derived by Profile and Permission Sets </li>
		<li>In Permission Sets are used to give extra access for any requirement </li>
		<li>In Record Level there are OWD,Role hierarchy,Sharing Rules and Manual sharing</li>
		<li>OWD can give base level security for records. In role hierarchy, the user in upper hierarchy can see the records of users of the lower hierarchy </li>
		<li>In Sharing Rules we can give some criteria for sharing the records and in manual sharing we'll share the records manually one by one </li>
		<li>Today I learnt about Queue and lead assignment rule </li>
