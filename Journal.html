                <li>Today we learnt about constructor in Apex</li>
		<li>Constructors are Are used to initialise the instance variables of the class,also we can do the work which has to be done at the time of object creation.</li>
		<li>Constructor is constructor is almost same as method but without return type not even void and also it has the same name as its class name always. </li>
		<li>Constructor can be of two types i.e. non parameterise constructor and parameterise constructors</li>
		<li>Today learnt about this keyword in Apex. this keyword is used for referencing the current object.</li>
		<li>when the instance variable and local variable is having same name then we need to apply this keyword with instance variable to make it different from local variable</li>
		<li>this keyword is also used for calling the current constructor of the class.</li>
		<li>Today learnt about inheritance in Apex. In inheritance, We use extends keyword and Parent class must be defined as virtual or abstract</li>
		<li>We learnt about super keyword in apex. super keyword is used to call parent class parameterise constructor</li>
		<li>Parent pp = new Child(34,'aa'); // upward casting // runtime polymorphism</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about Abstract Class in Apex. Abstract Classes are Partially implemented,Can have abstract and complete methods,If any method needs to declare as abstract then that 				method needs to declare as abstract using abstract keyword,They cant be instantiated ..</li>
		<li>Today we learnt about interfaces in Apex. Just like abstract class but they are fully abstract</li>
		<li>Interfaces methods are by-default public and abstract and Interfaces cant have variables ,cant have constructors ,can only have incomplete method</li>

                <li>Today we started the development module in Salesforce</li>
		<li>In development module we use Apex language for development on Salesforce</li>
		<li>Apex is strongly typed, object oriented programming language. Strongly typed means we should always specify the data type while working with variables</li>
		<li>Today learnt about Access specifier in Apex. There are four types of Access specifier i.e. Global,Public,protected,Private </li>
		<li>Today learnt about Apex variables and their data types. Various data types are Integer,Long,Double,Decimal -> currency type value,Boolean -> true/false,								String -> ‘’,Date,dateTime,sObject.ID</li>
		<li>Today learnt about casting concept in Apex. Casting can be done in two ways i.e. Downward casting -> long to integer (has to done explicitly ) and 								Upward casting -> integer to long (done automatically)</li>
		<li>Today learnt about Object oriented programming. In OOP, we learn Abstraction,Encapsulation,Inheritance,Polymorphism.</li>
		<li>Abstraction -> concept of hiding the complexity and showing the essential data as per requirement </li>
		<li>Encapsulation -> is concept of wrapping the variable and methods into single unit to prevent it from unwanted users.</li>
		<li>Inheritance -> one class/child class/derived class/sub class gets all non-private  property of another class/parent class/base class/super class</li>
		<li>Polymorphism -> one name and many forms..Two types of polymorphism : Compile time polymorphism / early binding / static binding => ex : method overloading							Runtime polymorphism/dynamic binding / late binding => ex : method overriding </li>
		<li>Today we learnt about Different types of variables in Apex</li>
		<li>First one is Instance variable  : gets loaded when object is created of that class,Every object will be having separate copy of instance variable,								If we want to access them so we need to call them using object</li>
		<li>Second one is Static variable/members  : gets loaded when class gets loaded ,Every object will be having same copy of static variable
				If we want to access them so we need to call them using Class Name</li>
		<li>Third one is Local variable : They declared inside the method or any block,They can be access within the class in which we have declared them</li>

                <li>Today learnt about Reports and Report Type in Salesforce</li>
		<li>There are four types of report i.e. Tabular report, Summary report, matrix report and joined report</li>
		<li>Today learnt about Dashboard in Salesforce. Dashboard is the collection of reports</li>
		<li>Today learnt about Chatter in Salesforce. Chatter is used for posting publicly in our Org. </li>
		<li>Today learnt about Feed Tracking in Salesforce. If Feed Tracking is enable for the object and we've selected some fields in Feed Tracking, then if there is any change in the 				respective field, then we can track it's detail</li>
		<li>Today learnt about how to create groups in chatter in Salesforce. There are five types of groups i.e. Public Group, Private Group, Customer Group, Broadcast Group and Unlisted Group			</li>
		<li>Today learnt about Data Management in Salesforce</li>
		<li>Data Management can be done in two ways, first one is Data Import Wizard and second one is Data Loader.</li>
		<li>Data Import Wizard is the internal tool of Salesforce. Used to import data for all custom objects but not all standard objects. standard objects which are supported -> 					account,contacts , lead ,solutions and campaign member</li>
		<li>In data import wizard we can import auto 50000 records and Mapping must be done evrytimes as its not saved for future..</li>
		<li>Data Loader is an external tool, and we can import data for all custom objects and standard objects. We can import/export upto 5 million records at a time</li>
		<li>In data loader import, export and deletion is possible. And Mapping can be saved for future</li>
		<li>Today learnt about External ID in Salesforce. It's a unique field for a object, which we can use for data management from any external system.</li>
		<li>External field data type can be Autonumber,Text,Number,Email</li>

                <li>Today I learnt about Approval Process in Salesforce by taking a example of Leave Request Approval process</li>
		<li>In approval process, there are three scenarios where first is each and every request must send to a single user, second one is let the submitter select the approver and the third one 		    is only managers can approve the request</li>
		<li>In approval process, I also learnt about recall the request... even after submitted for approval.</li>
		<li>And how to submit for approval automatically through flow when the record is created</li>
		<li>Today I learnt about Data Security in Salesforce</li>
		<li>In Data Security there are four levels that are Organisation level, Object Level, Field Level and Record Level </li>
		<li>In Organisation level there are password policies, login hours, login IP ranges and manage users </li>
		<li>In Object Level, Field Level there are mainly derived by Profile and Permission Sets </li>
		<li>In Permission Sets are used to give extra access for any requirement </li>
		<li>In Record Level there are OWD,Role hierarchy,Sharing Rules and Manual sharing</li>
		<li>OWD can give base level security for records. In role hierarchy, the user in upper hierarchy can see the records of users of the lower hierarchy </li>
		<li>In Sharing Rules we can give some criteria for sharing the records and in manual sharing we'll share the records manually one by one </li>
		<li>Today I learnt about Queue and lead assignment rule </li>
		<li>Today I learnt about Path settings and how to add guidance success path for an custom object </li>
